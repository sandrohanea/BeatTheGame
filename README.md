# BeatTheGame
A simple game solitaire-like where you're playing against the game even on your own or with your team.

# Support
Any help is appreciated.

# Ongoing work
- We need to improve the UI/UX(mobile friendly inclusive)
- We need to let the game know when a game session is won or lost
- We need to add interactive informations about the rules when the game is played for the first time.


# Deployment
After merging to the main branch, the version will be available at: https://beatthegame.sandro.rocks/
